  Car crashes are a very common occurrence in everyday life and are especially prominent in big cities such as New York. With the Motor Vehicle Collision Crashes dataset, I aim to provide evidence for my hypothesis that the number one cause of motor vehicle crashes is texting while driving. The dataset used was pulled from Data.Gov from the New York City Police Department. According to the CDC, over 3,100 people were killed and another 424,000 were injured in the United States due to a distracted driver in 2019. 
Investigating this dataset can help inform policy decisions, enforcement strategies, and public awareness campaigns aimed at reducing accidents and improving road safety.
