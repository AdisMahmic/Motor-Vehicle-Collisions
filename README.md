  <p align="center">A analysis on leading causes of death in car accident in New York </p>
</p>







































## :loudspeaker: Project Description:
Car crashes are a very common occurrence in everyday life and are especially prominent in big cities such as New York. With the Motor Vehicle Collision Crashes dataset, I aim to provide evidence for my hypothesis that the number one cause of motor vehicle crashes is texting while driving. The dataset used was pulled from Data.Gov from the New York City Police Department. According to the CDC, over 3,100 people were killed and another 424,000 were injured in the United States due to a distracted driver in 2019. 
Investigating this dataset can help inform policy decisions, enforcement strategies, and public awareness campaigns aimed at reducing accidents and improving road safety. <!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

This workshop has participants do ..
Lost In The Sauce is an unity made game that aims to teach basic coding fundamentals such as if and else statements as well as for loops and game development within the unity engine.
